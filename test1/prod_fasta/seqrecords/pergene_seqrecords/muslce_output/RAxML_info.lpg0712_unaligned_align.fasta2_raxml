IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 8 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file /scicomp/home/nej1/50scheme/test1//prod_fasta/seqrecords/pergene_seqrecords/muslce_output/lpg0712_unaligned_align.fasta2.fasta.reduced

RAxML Computation of pairwise distances

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

Partition: 0
Alignment Patterns: 34
Name: No Name Provided
DataType: DNA
Substitution Matrix: GTR




RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC -s /scicomp/home/nej1/50scheme/test1//prod_fasta/seqrecords/pergene_seqrecords/muslce_output/lpg0712_unaligned_align.fasta2.fasta -f x -m GTRGAMMA -p 8 -n lpg0712_unaligned_align.fasta2_raxml 



WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 16.549789 estimated by RAxML for partition number 0 with the name "No Name Provided"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!


Log Likelihood Score after parameter optimization: -1284.268889
