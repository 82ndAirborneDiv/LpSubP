In the folder named "outputfiles" in your test folder, you will find 6 output result files of your uploaded data.
Please read the descriptions below.

1. subtype_genomecount.pdf
X axis shows the subtype and Y axis shows the number of genomes falling into that subtype.
If you want to know the allele type in detail, you can go subtype_genomeid_count.txt file.

2. genome_subtype_count.tsv
First column shows you allele types for subtypes. 
Second column shows you the genome name, the third one shows you the count of genomes which have this certain subtype.

3. notest
I recommend to open this with excel or notepad++ to read easily.
It shows the geneID and genomeID when absence of gene occurs.
In [ ], you can see the result of blast.
If it is empty, it is true absence and if there are letters, it means either
truncated or assembly was not correct.

4. allstats.csv
General statistics summary according to 50 loci(Mean,Max,Min,Std)
It is based on ML distances 
Higher value means more variances among alleles.

5. allele_diff_matrix.csv
Result allele difference comparison between genome. All allele differences were normalized by the number of 
comparisons for each locus


6. dendrogram.pdf
Dendrogram shows the clusters at the right end.
Vertical lines are cluster merges and horizontal lines tell you which clustes were part of merge forming
that new cluster. 
This is also generated using matrix used in heatmap generation.
It is based on UPGMA. It corresponds to the similarity of genomes and not particularly represent 
the phylogenetic distance.

7 .genome_profile_allele_id.csv
This table is the similar to the result from bionumerics.
For each isolate in the row, each column shows the allele ID for 50 loci.

8. heatmap.pdf
Based on the allele difference matrix generated.

9. MLdistancematrix
This table is pairwise ML distancematrix from the output of RAxML.
It is generated for each locus.

10.genome_count_subtype_number.txt
This shows the total number of genomes analyzed and total number of subtypes in 
analyzed set.
